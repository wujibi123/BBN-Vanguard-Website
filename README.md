Here are a few things you should know before contributing to the website
- Master is linked to firebase hosting through Github Actions
    - So never commit to master unless your code has been reviewed and approved by others
- Firebase domain for now is https://bbn-vanguard.firebaseapp.com/.
    - Once we contact IT at the school, we can switch to http://vanguard.bbns.org/.
- Every update should go to development. Use GitHub Pages for rapid testing.
